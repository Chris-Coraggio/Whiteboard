# Description
Whiteboard brings the efficiency of collaboration to the freedom of drawing. Users can create and join a board, where each user on the board can introduce their strokes in real time. A history of strokes and erasures is kept to know how the document changes over time. Whiteboard is the solution to brainstorming in a virtual meeting or working on a project with elements that are hard to type.
